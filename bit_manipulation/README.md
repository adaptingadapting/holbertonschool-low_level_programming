README for the bit manipulation project

task 0 solutions is so beautiful, i had actually made up an elevatinvg algorithm in my mind and a super complicated sulution unrelated to bitshifting and then i see the actual intended way and it came down on me like a hammer, what an elegant elegant solution that incorporates a lot of common sense that i had applied to the other one but in a common way instead of a highly complicated one, as an example, you are shifting res to the left always, but it doesnt matter until you find the first '1', i had come up with a solution for that that nescessitated a function and like 2 ifs, the way it worked in the end is a simple or operator in the current bit which is of course much cleaner, that is just one of the many ways this solution really exploded my try into a thousand pieces. on to task 1, i might do that one without help now thanks to this

task 1 cost me quite a bit, the main problem were the traliing zeroes, they were actually leading zeroes when transformed into the reversed number and thus wouldnt be printed, i managed by keeping track of how mnay i would need to print and then printing thme after doing so for i, bit manipulation is cool

task 2 was rather simple, applying some of the concepts seen before in less detail

task 3 is another cute one, this one i solved quite quickly actually and for that im happy , i have to say though that i havent added the return -1 on "errors" function as i dont know how this program could fail, once i run this through the checks i will fix that

task 4 is rather simple again, it was harder than it needed to be for me to figure it out because i overlooked that the & operator would not turn 1 0 into 1 but once that was gone i did it quite quickly

task 5 took me a real low amount of time again, the time consumption was definetively all over the place in this porject so that is strange, in task 5 i thought of using the xor operator from minute one  and indeed it was a good aproach, surely the best one, then the implementation is only three lines so yeah, lets see the advanced ones
